# Multiprogramming
## A Guide for INF214 held at the University of Bergen
_Based on the lectures by Mikhail Barash and the research gathered by Casper Karlsen._ 

This repository has directories with exercises and solutions for some of the central subjects within the INF214
course. It was created as practice for the exam. It might contain errors, so it is wise to do the exercises yourself and 
check your own answers.
